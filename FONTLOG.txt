FONTLOG for the Elypian fonts

This file provides detailed information on the Elypian family of fonts.
This information should be distributed along with the Elypian fonts and
any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

Elypian is a display type font designed primiarly for logos, and 
titles. This font is inspired by origami; we imagine all glyphs
are made from strips of paper which may be folded to create
shapes forming abstract glyphs.

This is an elegant and modern take on an origami based font which is
designed to look good, even when flattened as a plain
single color Open-Type or True-Type font.
